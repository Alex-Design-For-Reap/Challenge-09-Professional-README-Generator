# Challenge 09: Professional README Generator

## Description

- My motivation for tbuilding this project is to make my life easier while creating README.md files for my projects.
- It helps me to be more productive and stay more focused on building new applications instead of writting readme files and being concerned about markup format.
- Learning:
  - I've learned specially how to create a README.md file dinamically while using `fs` and `inquirer` built-in module.
  - How to use `module.exports` to be used in another js file.
  - How to use node_modules, including it to my application.
  - How to install packages to my application and make it being installed automatically while calling a `init() function`.
